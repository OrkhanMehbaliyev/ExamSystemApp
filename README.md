Exam System App - Fully Front-end

There two types of profile:
  1.Student -> Takes an exam only
  2.Moderator -> Create classes, add and edit subjects, questions, and answers.

Exam type: 
  After logging in, students selects a class and join it. Then the app selects n number of questions and displays it as an exam.

Local storage has been used for storing the data.

The main aim of this project for me was to improve my vanilla JavaScript knowledge. So, the design was not a priority.
